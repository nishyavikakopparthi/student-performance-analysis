- Final performance result

Rows: 25,000  
Columns: 16

Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Analysis Performed
- Average marks calculation
- Pass vs Fail classification
- Study hours vs performance analysis
- Attendance vs performance analysis
- Data visualization using charts

Visualizations
- Bar chart: Pass vs Fail
- Scatter plot: Study Hours vs Average Marks
- Scatter plot: Attendance vs Average Marks

Project Files
